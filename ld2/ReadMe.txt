                        LD for QDOS v2.0
                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the new version of LD that supports a revised
binary format to support RLL libraries.

Note that the main documentation for this release of LD is
now provided in HTML format.  No special HTML features are
used so any suitable web browser should be capable of
displaying this documentation.

To get the best results it is recommended that you use
Microsoft Internet Explorer runnining on Windows.

Hopefully, one of these days there will be a QDOS based
browser that can display this documentation!
