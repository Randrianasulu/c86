		ld - Bruce Evans linker

	SYNOPSIS

		ld [-03Mimsz[-]] [-T textaddr] [-L libpath] [-l library]
			[-o outfile] objectfiles...

	DESCRIPTION

		The following command-line arguments may be used:

		-0      16-bit code as for a 8086

		-3      32-bit code as for a 80386 or better

		-i	seperate Instruction and Data (I&D) space

		-L libpath
			set the path for finding library files.

		-llibname
			specify the name of a library file.  The exact
			rules for expanding libname to the full filename
			of the library depend on settings used at the
			time that the ld program was built.  However
			the commonest treatment is that a prefix of 'lib'
			and a suffix of '.a' are added.  If this is the
			convention used then -ltest would mean use a
			library with the name libtest.a.

			The position of any -l parameters with respect to
			object files is significant in that both object
			files and libraries are processed in the order
			in which they occur in the command-line.  Also
			multiple occurrences of the -l parameter can be
			used as required.

		-M	print a list of the symbols linked

		-m	print a list of the modules linked

		-o outfile
			The name give to the output file.  If this parameter
			is ommitted then an implementation defined default
			will be used instead.  By convention this default
			name is typically a.out
		
		-r	Relocatable output (BSD only)

		-s	strip symbols

		-T	set text address.

		-z	unmapped zero page

		1.The description given here is by brief examination of
		the source, and has not been produced by Bruce Evans
		himself as the author of this program.  The descriptions
		given are therefore likely to either be incomplete or,
		even worse, contain errors.

		2.Not all of the options listed are always available.  It
		depends on what decisions were made at the time that the
		assembler was built.
